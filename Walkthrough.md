Since we got an html file for this problem, we will just inspect it with a browser instead of Ghidra.

We are prompted to enter a code, which we should be able to find embedded in the html code.

Here in inspect mode, we see the html code calls the function "calculate()" to check the password. We also find the definition of calculate() written as html script.

function calculate(){
  if(document[_0x30b0[2]](_0x30b0[1])[_0x30b0[0]]==_0x30b0[3]){
    document[_0x30b0[2]](_0x30b0[5])[_0x30b0[4]]=_0x30b0[6];} 
  else {
    document[_0x30b0[2]](_0x30b0[5])[_0x30b0[4]]=_0x30b0[7]
